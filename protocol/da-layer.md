# DA Layer

> Data Availability (DA) entails making the transaction data available. DA layer is a critical component for rollups to ensure the capability to reconstruct the the rollup states when the rollup service halts unexpectedly.

Both zkLink Nexus and zkLink Origin by default support the **primary chain** as the DA layer.

Secondly, both Nexus and Origin support **Validium**, which involves an **external DA** solution. zkLink will integrate various third party modular DA solutions, such as Celestia, EigenDA, Avail, etc., to meet diverse demands from developers.

Furthermore, zkLink DAO will have the option to organize a **Data Availability Committee** (DAC). This DAC serves as another option for developers, providing an additional choice for data availability assurance.
